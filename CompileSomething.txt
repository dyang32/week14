## Compiler
When you write programs, you need to compile them before you can run them. When you compile something your compiling the source code into a binary language that the computer can understand. Youâ€™re also making an executable file that can execute the code you wrote. 


## Compile Something

First create a docutment \
`touch newDoc.c`

Nano into the document using the followint command:\
`nano newDoc.c`

Type the following:\
`#include <stdio.h>`

`main() {`\
`printf("This is a newDoc, compile test");`\
`}`

Save and exit the document by pressing `Crtl+X` then `Y` then `Enter`

Run this command:\
`cc newDoc.c`

You should get an executable file named "a.out" that can be executed.
