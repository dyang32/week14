Our web server was already deployed by Alex from team Ops but Kao from our team is in the process of documenting the steps that Alex used.
I managed to get fileZilla working, it can connect to the web server just fine but ran into a problem. When I try to transfer files over it's always unsuccessful.
I managed to fix the problem by SSHing into the web server through the terminal and changing permissions of the file.

Our team is planning on making a webpage with a menu system so that each team can have there own page. We will present this to the class
to see if this is the direction everybody wants to go in before going further.
